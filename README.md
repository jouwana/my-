# my- arduino projects

* cars controlled by: IR, Bluetooth, PS2 controller. they also incorperate a simple automatic code that lets it drive on its own and evade bumping into obstacles:
    - BT_Manual
    - IR_Manual
    - PS2_controller_car

* car using 3 ultrasonic sensors to gauge distance and drive automatically without bumping into obstacles
    - 3_ultrasonic_car

* car built to automatically drive following a black line
    - Black_line_car

* robots with heartbeat sensors and temperature sensors, sensing temperature of room or of person.
    - heartbeat_sensor
    - tmp&bpm_measuting_app
    - temp_sensor_with_fans
 
 
* locking using rfid and fingerprint
    - RFID_Lock
    - fingerprent_oled
    
* a parking lot system, sensors on every lot to turn on light green/red based on if there is a car standing on it, a screen showing how many spots are left. sensor on exiting parking lot that signals a new spot opening up. as well as automatic boarder that opens up when there is space in the parking lot and it sees a car wanting to go in.
    - parking_lot



sadly there are no videos of the actual projects running, as i lost older data.
